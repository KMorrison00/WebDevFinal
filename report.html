<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The goal of the website was not only to inspire readers to take a closer look at the lore of the Game
    but also get a taste of the aesthetic and feel of the game's atmosphere. It is of course designed for adults
    as Elden Ring isnt a game for children and thus niether would prospective readers. Elden Ring is not a game
    of long exposition and lengthy dialogue so niether is the site. Short and sweet articles and a non-overwhelming
    layout to allow the reader to focus on the important items.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
    Obviously im a big fan of Elden Ring which inspired the colour palette and font. 
    Another one was modern social media and clickbait. I consume a pretty decent amount of internet
    content and something that always got me was clickbait which you can see the influence of in the 
    titles of the articles on the index page. Designed to capture your attention and make explore the site.
    Finally I was inspired by the youtube Elden Ring lore community. I love the obfuscated story telling in the game
    because it allows for a massive community of game lore hunters to figure out the story together, so the knowledge
    I gained there is what fills the content of the articles all over the site.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>
    I provided resonably desciptive alt text for every single image tag in the site. By wrapping everything
    in proper structural elements the entire site is navigable without a mouse including the catalog and carousel.
    finally by using a lighter gray colour for text on a very dark background as well as colouring text a bright yellow when hovered
    it gain visual contrast and accessibility
</p>
<br>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>
For hovering over links and articles with hidden links i added text highlighting and cursor changing. 
That way it is obvious to the user that an element is clickable and they are inside its click range.
Another one was making the labels attached to the filter checkboxes in the catalog clickable and attached
to its corresponding checkbox, rather than having the user have to be super precise with their clicks.
Another was adding drop shadows over all the articles on hover to make it clear the current user selection.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>
    I had to learn about shuffling algorthms in order to shuffle the items in the catalog when the checkboxeses activated.
    I found them through googling shuffling algorthms and applied the logic to my code. I had to learn about
    hiding overflow in css to create a variety of effects like the carousel and the responsive header bar, I did that by going through
    the W3 schools documentation. I also learned about CDN or Content Delivery Networks to get things like fonts and libraries.
    While I only ended up using the font I did have the Jquery and boostrap CDN's in my code for a while.
</p>

<h2>Evaluation 1</h2>
<p>
 I'm very happying with how the carousel turned out. It has arrow navigation and auto scrolling and still clean and simple.
 It was also my first javascrip implemented feature. I'm also happy with how the horizontal articles turned out. 
 They are a simple and modern design tha tis naturally responsive and was a good use of flex boxes unlike my midterm project.
 Overall i found cleaner designs to be better than fancy ones and that proved to make the major elements of the site
 not cluttered and function as intended.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Evaluation 2</h2>
<p>
I think my responsiveness is lacking a bit. While the website is responsive it only really works at 2 screen sizes 
due to the size of the carousel, designing mobile first is definetly something i should put more effort into next time
as i found it difficult to do the other way. As well the catalog wasn't quite up to my standards. I found it difficult to 
design a good method of image layout that would work with the filtering. I had trouble get images that had alpha
of the same style for the gods, leaving radagon and marika to be full images which makes them stand out in a bad way. 
As well if i were to do it again i would want some form of animation for making the images disappear and reappear rather 
than just popping in and out of existence.
</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
I primarily used W3 schools as the base for all my work along with my prior knowledge of interacting with
doms from writing web testing code at work. The one code i did take and not really modify was handling article clicks
([1] in script.js) just because it was a small thing allowing the articles on index page to be clicked adn there wasnt 
a need to modify it to make it my own. All of my images were sourced from the community ran elden ring wiki
on fextra life https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki and are fair use as they are non-commercial.
Beyond that i used the W3 validator tools and accessibility sites to double check my websites vailidity. As well
I used Figma to help make the mockup designs
