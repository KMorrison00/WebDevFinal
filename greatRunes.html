                            as a testament to the golden lineage.

                            Held by Praetor Rykard this great rune was distorted

                            and combined with the blasphemous serpent. Its
                            blessing is much like Rykard's blasphemy allowing
                            its bearer to absorb the health of fallen enemies.
