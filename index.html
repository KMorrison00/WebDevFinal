                            After being thoroughly thrashed by Malenia Hand
                            of
                            Miquella, Godrick the Grafted
                            (most recent in the bloodline of Godfrey of the
                            golden lineage) was brought low and humiliated
                            by the demigod of Radagon's line. Godrick
                            managed to
                            escape being executed by licking the boots
                            of the victorious demigod and continues to live
                            in
                            squalor in stormwind castle while slowly
                            grafting
                            more of his subjects onto his body.

                            betraying her to become a god
                            Queen Rennala holed herself up in her library
                            where
                            she has been using her great rune of
                            the unborn to continously rebirth her former
                            scholars. This has left them in a childlike

                        <p>
                            After thorough investigation of the lands
                            between.
                            We have uncovered that the Queen and current
                            Elden
                            Lord
                            are actually dual personalities of the Greater
                            Will.
                            This may come as a shock, but after seeing the
                            two
                            in person
                            we find that their bodies are stone, and the
                            broken
                            pieces are entirely filled with glowing runes.
                            They
                            seem
                            to now exist solely as servants to the greater
                            will.
